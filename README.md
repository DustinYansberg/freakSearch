## Title

Freak Search

## Description

Search Engine and Web API all in one for the entire archival records of Freakonomics. This tool allows a user to find any topic, person, or quote from any Freakonomics podcast episode.

## Why?

I listen to Freakonomics every week, and often something I heard on the show enters my discussions with friends. In these discussions, I frequently found my self struggling to remember which episode I heard a quote or tidbit. This struggle has lead to me being inaccurate or providing inadequate sources. To solve this problem, I decide to build a web application that allows me to remember where I heard that interesting tidbit I want to share with friends.

## Quick Start

This is a work in progress (WIP) Keep an eye out for the devlog to see where production stands.
